# RW10 local security-control truthfulness

Date: 2026-08-25
State: implementation complete; full technical regression and exact-head CI
pending

## Decision

Account-security controls are server-authoritative. The local fallback exposes
no password-change action, session list, remote-session revocation, logout-all
claim, two-factor switch or identity-verification simulation. The existing
backend routes remain the only implementation path; RW10 does not enable or
change that backend, an identity provider or a two-factor provider.

`AccountSecurityService` is the single client boundary. Every action starts
from a complete backend session marker made from account id, session id and
normalized email. Responses are accepted only while the same marker is still
current. Password change and logout-all then use an exact conditional local
session clear; a successor principal is preserved and the UI cannot report
success.

## Server-session contract

The session envelope must be a list of objects. It is not filtered or partially
salvaged. The complete list is limited to 100 unique, bounded session ids and
bounded non-empty device/location labels with valid timestamps. Exactly one
entry must identify the invoking session as current. Empty, malformed,
duplicate, missing-current or contradictory lists fail closed behind a
persistent retry surface.

The current session cannot be sent through the foreign-device revoke action.
Password and logout-all success requires the server call, the exact-session
recheck, conditional local removal and a final proof that no old session
remains. Debug logs contain only error runtime types and never passwords,
tokens, raw server envelopes or identifiers.

## UI and lifecycle contract

The offline screen states that account security is unavailable and renders no
password fields or session actions. The former locally persisted two-factor
preview and seeded device list are retired. The dedicated two-factor screen is
an unavailable explanation without switches, codes or method selection.

The screen subscribes to the shared account-security state event. Any session
change immediately clears password fields, devices, busy state and errors.
Revision and epoch guards discard stale loads and prevent an old async action
from changing a successor account's UI. Error state remains visible and
retryable. The offline view stays scrollable at 320 by 568 logical pixels with
200 percent text scaling.

## Legacy and process boundary

Legacy `security_settings_v1` and `signed_in_devices_v1` bytes are ignored and
never treated as account truth. RW10 deliberately does not normalize or erase
them while merely opening the screen. A separately reviewed migration or app
data clear is required if product policy later mandates removal.

SharedPreferences is not a transactional database across a hard process or OS
termination. The exact-marker comparison and removal invocation are adjacent,
and a successor session observed afterward is preserved, but an app termination
can interrupt the local cleanup. In that case RW10 makes no success claim; the
next launch must rely on normal session validation and re-authentication.

## Exclusions

RW10 changes no backend route or schema, production runtime, Firebase setting,
identity or two-factor provider, credential, external AI, contract, quote,
acceptance, payment, refund, payout, handover, return, damage, moderation,
candidate, device, Play, Store, VPS, DNS, Cloud, pilot, real-money,
legal-owner, PR-merge, GitGuardian-finding-content or Git-history gate.
