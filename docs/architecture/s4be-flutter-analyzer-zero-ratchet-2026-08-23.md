# S4BE Flutter analyzer-zero ratchet - architecture

Status: locally verified on 23.08.2026 at implementation commit `2fd646b`.
This is a non-live source and release-readiness reduction for `TD-RR-010`; it
changes no production, Payment, Store, Cloud/VPS/DNS or pilot state.

## Final source boundary

S4BE removes the final three analyzer-confirmed dead values. The active
message input never consumed its former composition flag or the related
animation controller and fade tweens; focus and text state already drive the
rendered `AnimatedSwitcher` and `AnimatedContainer`. The location-map fallback
was never constructed in its loading variant, so it now directly represents
its only reachable gradient/grid state. Listener registration, replacement and
disposal remain intact.

A permanent source contract rejects restoration of the disconnected animation
chain or the never-selected loading branch while protecting the active focus
transitions and listener lifecycle. The analyzer parser and complete technical
gate also recognize Flutter's native `No issues found!` summary as an exact
empty snapshot. Missing or inconsistent summaries still fail closed.

No contract, quote, acceptance, Payment, cancellation/refund,
handover/return, damage, `needsReview`, audit or later Business/Global
behavior changes. The message-thread source remains bound by the privacy
release inventory at exact hash
`3badcd1f2c08a4b67c545505c6e26699da9f9033cbad31e849b57104851510fd`.
The disclosure remains draft and fail-closed; no classification, approval or
release state changes.

## Analyzer ratchet and evidence

The exact analyzer snapshot reaches zero:

- total `3 -> 0`;
- `unused_element_parameter` `1 -> 0`;
- `unused_field` `2 -> 0`; and
- fingerprint
  `e68b4a8268abd0c878ad30d07122b584e4e92a0cc8f4621c83267f17e07133cf`
  -> `01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b`.

One hundred eleven focused source/analyzer/privacy/retention/data-integrity
contracts, 42 focused Flutter tests and all exact analyzer, privacy, retention
and G2 lifecycle validators pass. The complete standard-parallel technical
gate passed in one execution at `2fd646b`: 384 Flutter tests plus one
documented skip, the separate Google-only test, Web build and loopback smoke
and one direct 448-task Android debug build. S4BD exact CI run `32608259512`
is green at documentation commit `fe0faab`.

No retry, reduced parallelism, timing delay, alternate temp root, cache purge,
network switch, Pixel dependency or smaller complete suite was used. The data
volume exposed 1135 MiB before and 1144 MiB after the complete gate. This
warm-tree observation does not close `TD-RR-012`; deterministic release-host
capacity and bounded-growth evidence remain required.

The local source and deterministic-gate requirements of `TD-RR-010` are
satisfied. Formal closure waits only for green exact-S4BE-commit CI. P0B
remains `HOLD` / `NO-GO`.
