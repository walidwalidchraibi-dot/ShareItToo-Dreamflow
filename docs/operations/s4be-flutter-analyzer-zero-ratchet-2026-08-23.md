# S4BE Flutter analyzer-zero ratchet

Status: locally verified, non-live.

## Canonical checks

The focused source/analyzer/privacy/retention/data-integrity selection reports
111 passes and the Flutter selection reports 42 passes. Native
`No issues found!` output is normalized to the exact empty snapshot at
fingerprint
`01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b`.
The complete standard gate passes on implementation commit `2fd646b`.

## Failure and release boundary

Do not restore the disconnected composition animation-controller/tween chain
or the never-selected location loading branch. Do not weaken the active focus
transitions, listener lifecycle, exact empty analyzer snapshot, privacy source
inventory or fail-closed analyzer parsing. Do not add lint suppression, retry,
sleep, reduced concurrency or an alternate temp root.

S4BE needed no cleanup, network switch, Pixel or test accommodation: the
standard-parallel gate passed once with 1135 MiB available before and 1144 MiB
after. `TD-RR-012` remains open because this warm-tree observation is not the
required deterministic release-host proof.

This package changes no live availability, quote, Payment, refund, delivery,
cancellation, support, privacy/retention classification, audit or
`needsReview` behavior. `TD-RR-010` may be closed only after the exact S4BE
commit is green in CI. P0B remains `HOLD` / `NO-GO`.
