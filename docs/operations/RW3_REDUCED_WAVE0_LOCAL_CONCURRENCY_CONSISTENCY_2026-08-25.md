Focused RW3 result: 9 passed. The adjacent RW0/RW1/RW2, G2 persistence,
lifecycle and shared-refresh Flutter matrix passes 34 checks with the retained
profile skips. The G2 lifecycle validator now binds four local Gemerkt keys,
including the canonical atomic document.

The red-first matrix initially reproduced lost concurrent assignments, lost
custom folders, lost cart items, ignored canonical recovery and absent refresh
events. The implementation resolves each finding without a delay, retry,
serial test mode, rate-limit accommodation or timing threshold. The complete
candidate-rollover technical regression passes in CI-metadata mode, including
the full Flutter suite, Web/Wasm build and loopback smoke, Android debug build
and repository resource guard. Exact GitHub Regression/CodeQL verification
remains pending.

## Rollback

Revert the bounded RW3 implementation before a successor depends on it. The
canonical wishlist document, queues, change events, screen coordinators,
lifecycle update and tests form one consistency boundary and must not be
partially reverted.

## Gate truth

`BUILD_READY`, `PLAY_UPLOAD_APPROVED`, `HUMAN_PILOT_ACTIVATED`, external AI,
Payment and `PR7_MERGE_APPROVED` remain ungranted. The historical GitGuardian
owner review remains open. Focused local verification grants no live action.
