## Current evidence

- Focused RW10 Flutter matrix: 13 passed.
- RW10 plus B10 release-truthfulness matrix: 34 passed.
- Changed-file analyzer: zero issues.
- Full local technical regression: pending.
- Exact-head GitHub Regression and CodeQL: pending.

## Operational behavior

- Offline/local fallback presents no account-security mutation or success.
- Two-factor and identity verification remain explicitly unavailable.
- Server session payloads are decoded completely, strictly and within bounds.
- Every server response is tied to the exact invoking account/session/email.
- Password change and logout-all conditionally remove only that exact local
  session; a successor session is preserved and suppresses the success path.
- Session-change events clear password input and stale device/error state.
- Legacy local security-preview bytes are ignored and preserved without
  read-time normalization or silent deletion.

## Ratchet cause and verification

RW10 changes privacy- and retention-bound authentication, repository and local
data sources because it retires local security simulation and introduces an
exact conditional auth-session clear. The privacy and retention declarations
change only where their source hashes require refresh. Active-provider evidence
changes only to bind those reviewed hashes; its decision must remain
`prepared-hold`, 0/10 owner decisions and externally not ready.

Predecessor source inventories are refreshed mechanically only where shared
`AuthService`, `BackendRepository`, `DataService`, persistence-sync or the
supported regression changed. B10 is tightened to require the server-bound
service and to forbid the old debug two-factor exception, local setter and
timed fake password success. No earlier safety condition is relaxed.

## Recovery and rollback

Do not parse, normalize or delete legacy security-preview bytes during a read.
Malformed server session lists remain behind the retry surface. A process kill
during conditional local session removal can leave the old session present; it
must be revalidated or cleared through the supported auth flow, never inferred
as a successful RW10 action.

Rollback is a normal Git revert of the bounded RW10 code, tests, declarations,
ratchets, validator and evidence together. Do not reset, rebase or rewrite
history.

## Open gates

The GitGuardian owner-history review remains open and finding contents are not
inspected. BUILD_READY, Play upload, human pilot activation, PR #7 merge,
production/provider/AI, real money and every VPS/DNS/Cloud/Store/legal-owner
gate remain ungranted.
