Focused RW4 result: 13 passed. The combined RW4 and adjacent RW2/RW3/G2
matrix passes 51 checks. Changed-file analysis reports zero issues. The G2
lifecycle and predecessor wiring set passes 20 checks.

The red-first matrix first reproduced account-A saved state and cart visibility
for guest/account B, attribution of legacy bytes to a newly signed-in account,
and an export without principal scope. The bounded implementation resolves
those findings and adds deterministic immediate session-replacement,
bucket-local quarantine, process recreation, capacity, deletion and compact
stale-state proofs without a delay,
retry, serial test mode, rate-limit accommodation or timing threshold.

The complete candidate-rollover technical regression passes in CI-metadata
mode. It includes all repository validators, analyzer with zero issues, the
default Flutter suite with 440 passed and three documented exact-profile skips,
all exact RW profiles, Web/Wasm debug build and loopback smoke, Android debug
assembly with 448 tasks, merged-artifact checks and the release-host resource
guard. No candidate was signed, installed or uploaded.

## Rollback

Revert the bounded RW4 implementation before a successor depends on it.
Principal-token derivation, V3/V2 registry readers and writers, guest-only
legacy compatibility, auth transition events, lifecycle contracts and tests
form one isolation boundary and must not be partially reverted. A rollback
must not reinterpret account buckets as unscoped guest data.

## Gate truth

`BUILD_READY`, `PLAY_UPLOAD_APPROVED`, `HUMAN_PILOT_ACTIVATED`, external AI,
Payment and `PR7_MERGE_APPROVED` remain ungranted. The historical GitGuardian
owner review remains open. Focused local verification grants no live action.
