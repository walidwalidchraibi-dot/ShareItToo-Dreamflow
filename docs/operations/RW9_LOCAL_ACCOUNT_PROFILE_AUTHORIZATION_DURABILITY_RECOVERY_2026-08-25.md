## Current evidence

- Focused RW9 Flutter matrix: 13 passed.
- Changed-file analyzer: zero issues.
- G2 lifecycle, privacy, retention and provider-readiness validators: passed;
  provider result remains `prepared-hold`, 0/10 decisions and not externally
  ready.
- Full local technical regression: pending.
- Exact-head GitHub Regression and CodeQL: pending.

## Operational behavior

- User-facing profile writes require the matching current auth session.
- Caller-mutable fields exclude identity, verification, moderation, payout,
  reputation and deletion state.
- Optional profile values can be explicitly cleared without rebuilding a
  partial `User` snapshot.
- Both local profile documents fail closed on corruption or duplicate identity.
- A divergent current-account pair fails closed for mutation, privacy export
  and anonymization without changing either document.
- Each account document is bounded; overflow never prunes another profile.
- Observed paired-write failure restores both exact prior byte strings and does
  not poison the queue.
- Privacy export and deactivation are exact-current-account scoped.
- Local email change and local verification simulation remain forbidden.

## Recovery and rollback

Do not normalize, clear or partially salvage malformed `currentUser` or `users`
documents. Preserve exact bytes and perform a separately reviewed recovery.
Capacity exhaustion requires an explicit lifecycle or storage decision;
dropping cached profiles is forbidden.

Rollback is a normal Git revert of the bounded RW9 implementation before a
successor depends on it. Revert code, lifecycle, privacy, retention, provider
ratchet, validator and evidence changes together. Do not reset, rebase or
rewrite history.

## Open gates

The GitGuardian owner-history review remains open and its finding contents were
not inspected. BUILD_READY, Play upload, human pilot activation, PR #7 merge,
production/provider/AI, real money and every VPS/DNS/Cloud/Store/legal-owner
gate remain ungranted.
