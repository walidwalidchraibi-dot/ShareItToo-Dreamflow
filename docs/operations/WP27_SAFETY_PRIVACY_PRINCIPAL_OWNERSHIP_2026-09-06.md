# WP27 safety/privacy principal ownership

## Outcome

WP27 hardens the reachable user-report, block and unblock surfaces against
Account-A-to-B transitions. Every action now retains one immutable
principal/session owner and one screen-local action epoch from before its
first asynchronous boundary. The same owner is checked immediately before a
remote request, after the response, before any local cache write, before result
UI and before navigation.

Remote report, report-evidence and block-list requests resolve credentials only
for that captured token-free session owner. They never refresh or fall back to
the globally current account. Local safety state is written only to the
captured opaque principal. If A changes while B is current, A's late result is
discarded from B's UI and local state; a confirmed server-side A change is
reconciled when A next loads its authoritative state.

## Result truth

Only the following exact structured backend contracts are treated as a safe
rejection:

- `400`: invalid block/report target, reason, priority, evidence, details or
  reference; self/own-content reports; non-owned evidence; invalid harassment
  block-report fields;
- `401`: authentication required, invalid/expired session or inactive account;
- `403`: report target or upload forbidden;
- `404`: user, report target or upload not found;
- `409`: the defined harassment/report conflict states; and
- `429`: the structured `rate_limit_exceeded` contract.

HTTP `408`, intermediary responses, generic/unstructured 4xx, 422 and all
transport/5xx failures remain outcome-unknown. The UI therefore distinguishes
an exact rejection, a confirmed remote acceptance followed by local failure,
and a request that may have succeeded while its response was lost. Typed
results are handled before the generic catch and are not collapsed back into a
generic "not changed" message.

## Route and message-action ownership

Safety dialogs, general dialogs and sheets use exact route handles. An A-owned
route is dismissed on A-to-B invalidation, but the controller cannot pop the
current navigator route globally and therefore cannot close a newer B-owned
dialog or navigation element. The messages swipe menu now delegates before
its first await to an owner-capturing controller; the sheet close button and
every choice use that exact route handle. Read/archive/delete server calls also
retain the captured auth owner through mutation and authoritative refresh.

## Verification

- Flutter analyzer: zero findings across the 12 affected runtime files.
- Focused Flutter regression: 65 passed.
- Focused WP27/tool wiring: 15 passed.
- Complete repository tool inventory: 2,333 passed, zero failed.
- Full technical regression: passed, including 887 Flutter tests with 33
  declared skips, analyzer, Web/Wasm, loopback smoke and the Android debug
  build with minSdk 24.
- Exact-head GitHub Regression and CodeQL: pending the implementation push.

The source ratchets changed because the protected runtime files, disclosure
bindings and their dependent evidence hashes changed. The update is mechanical
and validated: it changes no historical status, legal conclusion, provider
selection, billing state, approval or live gate. The active provider remains
`prepared-hold`.

## Boundaries and remaining risk

WP27 changes no Firebase Console, provider configuration, payment, Google Play,
Production, public registration, Cloud/VPS/DNS, physical device, OnePlus or PR
merge state. It creates no Android candidate.

`report_issue_screen.dart` remains a distinct booking return-case/evidence
workflow using its existing report-upload path. It is deliberately not claimed
as covered by this user-safety package and remains the leading candidate for a
separate principal/epoch transaction package after WP27 closure.
