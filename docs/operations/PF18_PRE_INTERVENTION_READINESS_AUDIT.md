# PF18 pre-intervention readiness audit

Status: **TECHNICALLY PREPARED — EXTERNAL EVIDENCE REQUIRED — HOLD / NO-GO**

Observed: 2026-08-23

PF18 reconciles the exact PF17 repository/CI baseline, the Drive-bound Support
matrix, the current signed Android candidate and all eleven external gates into
one fail-closed machine-readable audit. It does not perform an external gate.

## Result

- all `11/11` external gates are technically prepared and `0/11` have
  authentic external acceptance evidence;
- all `167/167` Support scenarios retain automated non-live traceability and
  the `47` public-launch/real-money scenarios retain explicit external holds;
- PR #7 was open, Draft, clean, mergeable and unmerged at exact baseline
  `9cf0e6396d8b7bc596226f17a3e8d10d2f6b22af`; exact regression
  `32649746483` and CodeQL `32649746475` passed;
- Pixel 7 Pro remained reachable with exact direct candidate `2026082302`,
  restored font scale `0.85` and disabled accessibility services;
- the standard protected two-role Staging vault was not transferred. No new
  synthetic accounts were created. Current-candidate fixture listing, booking
  and chat links remain open until a protected vault is restored or a complete
  verified-email and deletion chain is available;
- all `21/21` deterministic Technical-Debt exit contracts remain closed.

The canonical action pack therefore still stops at `A1`. The only accepted
next answers are `PF3_A1_QUOTE_REQUEST_PACK_GO` or `PF3_A1_HOLD`. Any quoted
cost requires a separate approval before commitment.

## Boundaries

PF18 creates no account, accepts no terms or contract, spends no money, changes
no permission, Store, Firebase, provider, Payment, production, Cloud/VPS/DNS,
pilot or public state, issues no release token and does not merge PR #7. The
retained audit contains no credentials, account identity or raw device/network
identifier.

## Validation

Six PF18 evidence-validator tests and 45 focused aggregate Gate, Support and
candidate tests pass. The complete supported Mac-mini metadata gate passes
backend/PostgreSQL/tooling, 387 Flutter tests plus one documented skip,
Web/Wasm, loopback smoke, one 448-task Android build, binary minSdk 24 and the
fixed capacity budget with 12 KiB generated growth.
