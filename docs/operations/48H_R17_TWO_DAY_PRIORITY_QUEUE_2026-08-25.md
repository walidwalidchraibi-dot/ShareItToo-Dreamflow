# R17 two-day priority queue

Status: **IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY — FULL REGRESSION PASSED — CI PENDING**

R17 starts from exact R16 closure head
`dda99ed03660c509d3e713799b7001e4e6680b79` and works only the three findings
admitted by R16. It does not open another product, Support, Business, Global,
Payment, migration or provider package.

## Finding results

### `R16-P0-SEC-HISTORY-001` — owner gate prepared, still open

No secret value was read, copied or inferred. The exact safe owner procedure
and completion token are recorded in
`docs/operations/48H_R17_GITGUARDIAN_HISTORY_REVIEW_OWNER_GATE.md`. Until the
current GitGuardian check succeeds, build, upload, human pilot and PR merge
tokens remain invalid. Independent code work is complete.

### `R16-P1-STAGE-A-BINDING-001` — resolved fail-closed

Every Blue Ocean release candidate now receives
`SIT_STAGE_A_NON_BINDING_PILOT=true`; the same truth is stored in the private
archive manifest and the archive rejects a Blue Ocean artifact if the gate is
missing. The local Blue Ocean QA builder carries the same flag.

In that mode, Flutter does not load a binding remote quote, display contract
declaration checkboxes or enable request submission. It shows an unverbindliche
price simulation and the disabled action `Mietanfrage im Stage-A-Pilot
gesperrt`. The default V5.2 development configuration remains binding so its
legal/contract regression continues to run. That retained regression exposed
and corrected one stale client-build declaration (`2026082301` versus the
actual repository build `2026082302`), so future immutable acceptance metadata
again names the exact client build.

### `R16-P1-WAVE0-SURFACE-001` — resolved by honest scope reduction

G3/G4/G5 remain release-mode locked. The corrected participant path contains
only closed-Staging listing work, search, project/Saved, non-reserving cart and
feedback. Rental request, accept/reject, Payment/Refund/Payout,
handover/return/damage/`needsReview` and G3/G4/G5 are explicitly `not-run`.
The previous R14/N9 documents remain historical; the R17 template supersedes
their broader human task list for the next candidate.

## Changed behavior and rollback

The change is build-time, narrow and reversible: removing the Stage-A define
returns the ordinary binding V5.2 development path, while the release builder
itself always couples Blue Ocean to non-binding. No migration or stored data is
changed. Before an authorized build, rollback is a normal revert of the R17
implementation commit. Never weaken the archive check to make an artifact pass.

## Verification

Focused legacy checkout, Stage-A profile and archive tests pass; the Stage-A
profile is compiled with the exact non-binding dart define. R17 artifact tests,
privacy/source hash validation and the full candidate-rollover regression pass
in CI-metadata mode. Exact GitHub Regression and CodeQL verification remain
pending and are bound in the machine evidence. No candidate was built, no Pixel
or human data was changed and no live surface was accessed.

Next package after exact verification: `48H_REMOTE_READINESS_DECISION` only.
