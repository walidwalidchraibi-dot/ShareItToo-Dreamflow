# 48H remote readiness baseline

Version: `R0-48H-REMOTE-2026-08-24.1`

Status: **VERIFIED BASELINE — P0 CODE-SCANNING CONTRADICTION OPEN**

Goal boundary: non-live autonomous preparation ending at
`48H_REMOTE_READINESS_DECISION`. This is a new R0–R17 goal and does not reopen
or continue N0–N13.

## Authoritative starting artifact

The current SIT Codex Drive folder was listed and the newest starting artifact
was read back from Drive:

- `06_STAGE_A_BLUE_OCEAN_DECISION_HANDOVER_2026-08-24.md`
- Drive file ID `11GsMbfw7ZhkC4FuCmpLdFmniyHTaIO30`
- N13 final gate `STAGE_A_BLUE_OCEAN_DECISION`

The handover remains the product-state baseline. The current GitHub security
state below is newer and materially changes the security-readiness conclusion.

## Repository and pull request

- Repository: `walidwalidchraibi-dot/ShareItToo-Dreamflow`.
- Branch/upstream: `codex/master-workflow-20260808` /
  `origin/codex/master-workflow-20260808`.
- Verified baseline HEAD and upstream:
  `6d4e66e1d832b33d50ec1c44e624e45d635eff12`.
- Working Tree: clean; no stash or local/upstream divergence was observed.
- PR #7: open, Draft, unmerged, mergeable, merge state `BLOCKED`, base `main`.
- No history rewrite, merge, Store, Cloud, Production, payment or external
  provider action was performed.

## CI and material CodeQL contradiction

- Regression workflow `32678159654`: success at the exact baseline HEAD.
- CodeQL workflow `32678159650`: success at the exact baseline HEAD.
- GitHub Advanced Security PR check `97290219956`: **failure** with 22 new
  high-severity alerts.
- The 22 annotations comprise nine missing-rate-limit findings on the three
  Blue-Ocean draft analyze/review/publish routes and thirteen potential
  filesystem race findings in the N1–N13 validators.

Therefore a green workflow is not treated as a green PR security state. The
handover's exact N13 workflow evidence is retained, but the current PR is
security-red until the Advanced Security check is clean. These findings are P0
for this goal and must be addressed before device or pilot-readiness claims.

## Toolchain, dependency and analyzer state

- Flutter `3.41.7`, Dart `3.11.5`, Java `17.0.20.1`, Node `22.23.2`, pnpm
  `11.16.0`.
- `flutter analyze`: `No issues found!`.
- Backend production dependency audit: no known vulnerabilities.
- Technical Debt register: 21/21 deterministic exit contracts recorded closed;
  the retained no-workaround rules remain binding.

## Database and support state

- Migration level: `068_blue_ocean_listing_workflow`.
- Migration inventory: 68 `up` files and 41 designed `down` files.
- Support Matrix: 167/167 scenarios technically mapped; 47 require external
  evidence and 0 have that evidence.
- External gates: 11/11 technically prepared, 0/11 externally ready; release
  decision remains `hold-no-go`.
- Pilot tiers: none activated.

## Protected Android and Firebase state

- `android/key.properties`, Android Firebase configuration and Apple Firebase
  configuration are present, owner-only (`0600`), Git-ignored and untracked.
- Android signing validator: canonical upload certificate relationship passes.
- Candidate-rollover release preflight: passes for package
  `com.shareittoo.app`, version `1.0.0+2026082302`.
- Firebase validator: Android configuration valid, Analytics absent; overall
  state remains partial because Apple configuration is not part of the Android
  Stage-A validation lane.
- No protected value, signing material or account identifier was copied into
  this report.

## Feature and Stage-A boundaries

- Private pilot code path exists, while delivery, real payments and general AI
  features remain disabled.
- Blue-Ocean listing assistant defaults off and is test-only when explicitly
  compiled for the mock lane.
- Backend listing provider defaults to `disabled`; only the deterministic mock
  lane is executable for this goal. External provider execution, provider
  publication and provider price authority remain false.
- G3/G4/G5 technical surfaces default off and are unavailable in release mode.
- Regional Price Engine V2 remains server-authoritative; synthetic observations
  have zero real-learning weight.
- Public registration, binding Stage-A rental, real money, public Store release
  and human-pilot activation remain unauthorized.

## Pixel visibility

- Exactly one authorized physical Android device is reachable through ADB.
- Sanitized model check: Pixel 7 Pro, Android 17.
- SIT package presence: yes.
- No raw device identifier, unrelated media or private device content was read
  or recorded.
- Installed version/signature/data-preserving update eligibility remain R1/R2
  checks and are not claimed by this baseline.

## Binding risks and next action

```text
PROFESSIONAL_REVIEW_DEFERRED_BY_OWNER

These markers are not professional approval. R0 is complete with one material
P0 contradiction: remediate and independently re-check the 22 GitHub Advanced
Security findings before proceeding to R1.
