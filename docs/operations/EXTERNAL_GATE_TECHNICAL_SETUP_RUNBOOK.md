# External gate technical setup runbook

Status: technically prepared, all external gates remain `HOLD` / `NO-GO`.

This runbook gathers the existing Legal, Operations, Device, Firebase, Support
Evidence Scanner/Upload Policy, PSP, Privacy/Retention, Store, Economics and
Pilot gates into one setup sequence. It does not replace their canonical
runbooks and does not authorize an external change. The machine source is
`docs/evidence/external-gates/technical-setup-manifest.json`.

## Current preflight

From the repository root:

```sh
node tool/validate_external_gate_setup.mjs
```

Expected result: `prepared-hold`, eleven technically prepared gates, zero
externally ready gates, 167 mapped Support scenarios, 47 externally open
Support scenarios, eight open scanner/upload decisions and `hold-no-go`.

The final check is intentionally red today:

```sh
node tool/validate_external_gate_setup.mjs --require-ready
```

Never weaken that failure. After authentic external evidence exists, update
the canonical gate artifact first, add only a sanitized evidence reference,
then update this manifest and its validator in a reviewed commit.

## Configuration sequence with Walid

1. **Legal and operator:** send the prepared 18-decision V5.2/G3 intake to an
   independent professional reviewer. Record no reviewer name or contact data
   in Git. Final operator/imprint facts, approved hashes and public text remain
   external evidence.
2. **Operations:** choose the authoritative company system, assign six primary
   roles and six distinct delegates, verify RBAC/MFA, then run four real
   72-hour absence tests. Git receives opaque evidence references only.
3. **Apple/iOS:** only after Walid explicitly accepts any membership cost,
   install/select full Xcode and CocoaPods, confirm Apple agreements/signing,
   create the app record and run a physical iPhone/TestFlight matrix. Android
   current-source direct-device evidence is already passed; Store installation
   remains separate.
4. **Firebase:** while Walid is present in the owner account, confirm current
   terms and the required FCM/APNs, deletion/retention and Maps-key controls.
   Never copy keys or account identifiers into chat or Git.
5. **Support Evidence Scanner/Upload Policy:** choose a reviewed managed or
   self-hosted malware scanner, approve provider/security/privacy facts, file
   size and MIME rules, Retention/Legal Hold, operator procedures and exact
   candidate/environment binding. Keep intake disabled and use only synthetic
   files until every decision passes the dedicated runbook.
6. **PSP:** select and contract a licensed marketplace product, obtain the DPA,
   region/transfer and professional checkout evidence, place test credentials
   only in an approved secret store, then run the existing eight sandbox
   scenarios. Sandbox is not real-money authorization.
7. **Privacy/Retention:** decide the six Privacy/form questions and ten
   retention/legal-hold periods using professional and owner evidence. Keep
   Store questionnaires draft until source, processor and final binary facts
   agree.
8. **Store:** Google Play account setup is already ready. Complete the real
   closed-test requirement, protected review-account fields, final binary and
   accessibility matrix. Apple remains blocked by step 3. Do not upload or
   submit merely because metadata validates.
9. **Economics:** enter authentic provider fees, VAT component, Cloud costs,
   founder hours/replacement rate and attribution evidence. An unavailable
   value is never zero and planning targets are never observed results.
10. **Pilot envelope:** only after the four P0B prerequisites are green, prepare
   the exact invited Spiegelberg Cat8 synthetic-payment roster and region
   configuration. Keep public registration, G3/G4/G5, live provider traffic
   and real money disabled.
11. **Activation:** Walid makes a separate explicit decision last. Technical
    readiness, account login or the existence of credentials is never that
    decision. The exact 47-scenario Public Launch and Real Money hold must also
    be zero before a release-ready claim.

## Data and cost boundary

Do not store names, emails, account IDs, device IDs, credentials, secrets,
payment details, tester rosters or private filesystem paths in the manifest.
Do not start a paid membership, subscription or contract without Walid's
specific cost approval. Do not change production, VPS, Cloud/DNS, Payment,
Store, pilot, public activation or real-money state while using this runbook.
