# WP69 — current-goal acceptance audit

Status: **COMPLETE LOCALLY AND ON GITHUB**.

## Exact candidate and runtime

- Branch: `codex/master-workflow-20260808`.
- Audit base: `6e21a49ca183ec6fc8dca3489aeaa3b32abf98ed`.
- Android candidate source:
  `12b88cf97f91973d6dfd59fe3f4dcb9c915dc7d0`.
- Candidate: `com.shareittoo.app` `1.0.0+2026090904`, Internal Staging.
- APK SHA-256:
  `8c5e02d309f39d808d900c5d8d59a862efbf9d1928a6baacf7fc2d7e2b62b8e4`.
- Staging runtime:
  `78c663248aec089b08d19fd0fb40a9a63f19408b`.

The Pixel remains connected and authorized with the exact installed candidate.
The OnePlus is not currently visible to ADB on the MacBook and is therefore
neither installed nor tested in this package.

## Evidence rule

The 32 goal requirements are classified as `PASS`, `PARTIAL` or `OPEN`.
`PASS` requires exact-current-candidate proof or a predecessor proof whose
relevant runtime paths remain unchanged and which has no contrary current
observation. A merely implemented surface or an older candidate pass is not
silently promoted.

The broad physical baseline at source
`2055a5c508689596c0f776c2cdf38b54f7e106c3` differs from current candidate
source only in:

- `lib/config/private_pilot_config.dart`;
- `lib/screens/payment_checkout_screen.dart`;
- `pubspec.yaml`.

No mobile or Backend runtime path changed after current candidate source
`12b88cf97f91973d6dfd59fe3f4dcb9c915dc7d0`.

## Current result

| State | Count | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| PASS | 11 | Exact or safely inherited proof exists with current counterchecks. |
| PARTIAL | 12 | Implementation or narrower proof exists, but exact current-candidate coverage is incomplete. |
| OPEN | 9 | A physical device, provider, professional legal approval, authorized staff action or release-infrastructure change is still required. |

The Pixel/Staging core is nearly testable, but the app is not production-ready.
The most important open classes are:

- Facebook and Apple provider setup;
- real runtime image analysis;
- Stripe sandbox payment, refund and simulated payout;
- binding V5.2 contract/return/damage;
- human TalkBack traversal;
- OnePlus cross-device proof;
- durable least-privilege private-registry pull;
- recovery of two historical noncritical Support deadlines.

The source/evidence baseline remains green at
`b10528a15e4061dc528087d41297976f07bef3e0`: GitHub Regression
`34328892643`, CodeQL `34328892603` and zero current PR-merge alerts. PR #7
remains Draft, open, mergeable and unmerged. WP69 package commit
`1f09df3e000047d03198163d34c10d077926e559` also passes the full local
technical regression, 2,504 local tool tests, GitHub Regression `34333546679`,
CodeQL `34333546716`, and zero current PR-merge alerts.

## Next safe package

WP70 will stay on the Pixel and replay the highest-value current-candidate
gaps that need no provider or live mutation: fresh e-mail/auth/session truth,
report/block isolation and the visible fail-closed payment-provider hold. It
must not call Stripe, create binding V5.2 state, use money, change provider or
Firebase configuration, or contact OnePlus.

No application or Backend runtime, deployment, Production, Google Play,
tester list, provider, Firebase Console, payment, legal approval, Cloud/VPS/DNS,
OnePlus or PR state changed in WP69.
