Date: 2026-08-25
Run mode: synthetic local implementation and verification only

```

Focused RW5 result: 12 passed. The first adjacent run passes 37 checks with one
expected profile-gated skip. Changed-file analysis passes with zero issues.
Lifecycle/privacy/retention and RW4/RW5 wiring pass 95 Node checks. The full
technical regression and exact GitHub runs are recorded only after they
actually pass.

## Operational behavior

- Account and guest state are selected by an opaque principal token.
- Unattributed legacy data is guest-only; muted legacy data requires an exact
  owner-to-principal match.
- A corrupt current bucket is quarantined and fails closed without blocking a
  different valid account.
- The 13th retained principal is rejected; no prior state is evicted.
- A session switch refreshes every affected open screen without a delay and
  clears stale values before loading.
- Privacy export and confirmed deletion operate on the current principal only.
- The backend remains authoritative when enabled.

## Recovery and rollback

If a local bucket fails validation, do not delete or rewrite the raw document.
Keep the closed UI, preserve quarantine evidence, and repair only through a
separately reviewed migration. A storage-capacity failure requires an explicit
data-lifecycle decision; silent LRU eviction is forbidden.

Rollback is the normal Git revert of the bounded RW5 implementation before a
successor depends on it. Do not reset, rebase or rewrite history. A rollback
must also revert the canonical lifecycle/privacy/retention claims together; it
must never restore silent corrupt-to-empty behavior.

## Open gates

RW5 does not inspect historical GitGuardian finding contents and does not close
that owner gate. BUILD_READY, Play upload, human pilot activation, PR #7 merge,
real provider/AI, real money and every production/VPS/DNS/Cloud gate remain
ungranted.
