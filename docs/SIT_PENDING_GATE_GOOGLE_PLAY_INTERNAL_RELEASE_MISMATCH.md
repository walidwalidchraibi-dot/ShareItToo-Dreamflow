# SIT pending gate: Google Play Internal release mismatch

Gate ID: `GOOGLE_PLAY_INTERNAL_RELEASE_GO`

Status: **HOLD - READ-ONLY GATE CHECK FAILED**

Recorded: 27.08.2026

## Decision

Do not activate or otherwise change the Google Play release. The exact owner
gate was received, but its mandatory read-only preconditions were not all
green. The check stopped before `Next`, preview, confirmation or release
activation.

## Repository provenance at gate entry

- Worktree: `SIT-master-workflow-20260808`.
- Branch: `codex/master-workflow-20260808`.
- HEAD: `588fabda7da3abc53174d6e8c12124ab9f24ea23`.
- Working tree: clean.
- Remote divergence: ahead `0`, behind `0`.

## Directly verified green facts

The authenticated Google Play Console was inspected without changing it.

- The selected track is `Internal testing`.
- Its current draft is `2026082601 (1.0.0)` and remains `Draft`.
- Active Internal release `1.0.0-internal-2026081509` remains available to
  internal testers.
- The Console identifies the app as `com.shareittoo.app`.
- Bundle Explorer identifies the draft artifact as `2026082601.aab (1.0.0)`.
- The original artifact downloaded read-only from Bundle Explorer is exactly
  `108538228` bytes.
- Its independently recomputed SHA-256 is exactly
  `8cf36552f39fe9558411809518b374c437125cbd6ef123258ad9df7061acd873`.
- ZIP integrity passed without error.
- Its upload-certificate SHA-256 is exactly
  `098f485e57161558e911fc3c742845925584db31c474cdba08dda02feb0129a4`,
  matching the candidate manifest.
- Conventional JAR signature verification reports `jar verified`; strict PKIX
  verification rejects the expected self-signed upload certificate and is not
  treated as a different signer.
- Bundle Explorer reports API `24+`, target SDK `35`, four screen layouts,
  three ABIs, three required features and 15 permissions.
- The release editor states that releases are signed by Google Play and that
  automatic protection is on.
- The downloaded original is outside Git, retained owner-only with mode `0600`,
  and contains no new repository credential or tester identity.

These facts bind the Play artifact directly to the prepared candidate source
head `a1aa3f2528f1923c092a1fb15bdd3dc083673890`, version code `2026082601` and
candidate manifest. Candidate-hash verification is therefore **YES**.

## Blocking mismatch

The prepared upload handoff specifies:

- release name `1.0.0-internal-2026082601`;
- non-empty German release notes from
  `store/google-play/de-DE/blue_ocean_internal_release_notes.txt`.

The actual draft editor instead shows:

- release name `2026082601 (1.0.0)`;
- `Release notes provided for 0 language` and an empty German notes field.

Changing either value would be a Store-metadata mutation that the supplied
gate explicitly forbids. The existing gate therefore cannot authorize a
correction and cannot be used to activate the mismatching draft.

The editor additionally shows the unresolved informational signal:

`Upload your app bundle again to apply enhancement changes`

No repeat upload is authorized. The effect and origin of that signal must be
resolved or explicitly accepted before release activation.

## Checks intentionally left incomplete after fail-fast stop

Because the first material mismatch triggered the mandatory stop, this run did
not claim complete proof for:

- the current Google Play app-signing certificate details beyond the verified
  upload certificate and the Console's Google Play signing status;
- a full Data Safety and Store-metadata diff;
- unchanged tester-group membership;
- unchanged Production, Open testing and Closed testing states;
- absence of every possible newer or competing release outside the inspected
  Internal track.

Those items remain `NOT_PROVEN`, not passed.

## Confirmed non-actions

- No `Next`, preview or confirmation action was taken.
- No release was activated, published or sent for review.
- No AAB was uploaded or replaced.
- No release name, notes, Data Safety or Store metadata was changed.
- No tester list or track setting was changed.
- No Production, Open testing or Closed testing action occurred.
- No device was installed, contacted or controlled.
- No Firebase, Payment, provider, VPS, Cloud, DNS or PR-merge action occurred.

## Required resolution

The gate remains closed. Resume only after Walid supplies a new explicit
instruction that resolves the release-name and release-note mismatch and states
how to handle the enhancement notice. A resumed run must repeat the complete
read-only gate check before any Store mutation. Never infer permission to edit
metadata, upload another artifact or activate this draft from the consumed but
failed `GOOGLE_PLAY_INTERNAL_RELEASE_GO` token.
