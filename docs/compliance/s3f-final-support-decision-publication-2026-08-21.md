# S3F final support-decision publication - technical compliance record

Status: implementation candidate under local verification, non-live and
fail-closed. Exact GitHub CI is required before closeout.

The packet requires a clear final decision, effect, reason, implementation and
review route. RED templates remain human-approved and never auto-send.

## Implemented controls

- Three new user-facing statements join reason and redress route inside the
  immutable proposal and exact approval hash.
- Reversible migration `035` adds all-or-none payload constraints,
  communication truth, immutable communication evidence and a database guard
  that blocks decision-backed resolution before publication.
- A new stepped-up administrator route records publication only after approved
  and verified implementation truth in simulation/internal-testing mode.
- The publication event and audit state that no external message was sent.
- Authenticated case detail returns a minimal user projection; internal codes,
  implementation references, hashes and staff identities are excluded.
- Flutter renders the five required sections and fails closed for incomplete,
  contradictory or malformed data.
- Communicated fields join the personal-data export. Exact Privacy/Retention
  source inventories remain draft and blocked.

## Verification so far

- Complete backend suite: 395 passed, zero failed and one expected PostgreSQL
  skip; the backend JavaScript and operations-shell syntax checks passed.
- Complete CI-equivalent technical regression passed, including 341 Flutter
  tests, one expected Flutter skip, the Web build and the Android debug build.
- Focused support domain/workflow: 51 passed, zero failed.
- Flutter support cases: 9 passed, zero failed.
- Privacy and retention validator suites: 58 passed, zero failed.
- P0B PSP and invited-pilot validators: 11 passed; provider contract,
  sandbox E2E, real money and pilot eligibility remain false.
- JavaScript syntax checks passed for the changed application and workflows.
- PostgreSQL 16 execution of migration `035` remains delegated to exact-commit
  GitHub CI because the Mac mini has no local Docker runtime.

## Persistent boundaries

- No message template is rendered or sent; no push, email or SMS occurs.
- No appeal or reopen execution is claimed. The approved redress route is
  displayed as text only.
- No refund, payout, account action, provider call, payment, production, Cloud,
  VPS, Store, DNS, public pilot or real-money state changes.
