# ShareItToo Repository Guidance

## Scope and authority

This file applies to the entire repository. Follow the newest explicit Walid
decision for the specific subject, then `docs/current_work_package.md`,
`docs/current_state.md`, validated machine-readable manifests, and versioned
architecture/operations evidence. Treat the root `architecture.md` as a
historical prototype snapshot.

Work on one bounded package at a time. A green package may continue only within
the currently authorized runway. Stop on contradictory evidence involving
money, contracts, privacy, security, release truth or user data.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Do not reset, rebase, squash, force-push, delete branches, rewrite history or
  discard work. Preserve a verified rollback before any integration choice.
- Do not change production, VPS/OpenClaw/Maximus, DNS, cloud billing, repository
  visibility, live payment mode, stores or public rollout without a dedicated
  gate.
- Do not invent operator, register, provider, tax, legal, privacy, retention or
  approval facts. Existing draft/open/blocked states remain fail-closed until
  their named authority approves them.
- Never expose, commit or copy secrets, signing files, Firebase configuration,
  account identifiers or raw device identifiers into reports or evidence.
- Routine tests must not send real email, SMS, push, payment, KYC or other live
  provider traffic.
- Germany/private-adult pilot boundaries remain active: no vehicles/transport,
  paid delivery, shipping, express, deposit, SIT insurance/protection, real
  money, ads, marketing analytics or external generative AI.
- FCM is transactional only. Crashlytics requires its own voluntary choice.
  General Firebase Analytics remains off.

## Repository map

- `lib/`, `test/`: Flutter client and tests.
- `backend/src`, `backend/sql`, `backend/test`: Node API, PostgreSQL schema and
  backend tests.
- `tool/`, `scripts/`, `test/tool`: fail-closed validators, release tooling and
  their regression tests.
- `store/`: machine-readable Store, privacy, legal, retention and device state.
- `docs/architecture`, `docs/operations`, `docs/compliance`, `docs/evidence`:
  versioned design, runbooks and sanitized evidence.

## Change workflow

1. Confirm the real checkout, branch, HEAD, remote relationship and working
   tree before editing.
2. Read only the active package inputs and inspect nearby code/tests before
   changing behavior.
3. Keep changes narrow and reversible. Add or update a focused regression for
   behavioral fixes.
4. If a file listed in a `sourceInventory` changes, update every exact binding
   for that path to the file's SHA-256 and run the associated validators. A hash
   refresh never authorizes changing legal/privacy claims or approval state.
5. Run focused checks first. Run the complete technical regression at package
   and release gates.
6. Use `git add -- <confirmed paths>` only. Review the staged diff and never use
   add-all. Push only fast-forward to the intended branch; do not merge PR #7
   unless separately authorized.
7. Record status, behavior, tests, migrations, risks, rollback and the next
   package/gate in a concise handover.

## Verified toolchain and checks

- Flutter 3.41.7 / Dart 3.11.5 and Java 17.
- Backend Node >=22 with pnpm 11.16.0 and the locked dependency graph.
- Focused Flutter: `flutter test <test paths>` and
  `flutter analyze <changed Dart paths>`.
- Backend: from `backend/`, run `pnpm test` and `pnpm run check`.
- Full gate: `SIT_ALLOW_CANDIDATE_ROLLOVER=1 bash scripts/technical_regression_check.sh`.
  The Mac-mini local metadata-only handoff check may additionally use `CI=true`;
  this must not be used to claim a Store upload or device pass.
- When the current work package records a dedicated Mac-mini build-cache
  profile, run full gates and release builds through
  `node tool/run_with_local_build_cache.mjs --profile <private-profile.json> -- <command>`.
  See `docs/operations/WP02_BUILD_WORKSPACE_2026-09-04.md`. Keep the private
  profile outside Git; do not silently fall back to the global cache or repeat
  cache purges. The normal source-capacity and release gates still apply.
  Current Mac-mini Android gates/releases use the version-2 profile documented
  in `docs/operations/WP05_SCOPED_ANDROID_ENTRYPOINT_2026-09-04.md`; it supplies
  both SDK variables and isolated Flutter configuration, verifies effective SDK
  selection, and refuses global overrides. The historical version-1 cache-only
  profile does not provide this Android prerequisite.
- Run `git diff --check` before staging. Preserve the analyzer baseline and do
  not suppress forbidden analyzer codes to make a check pass.

Protected Android signing and Firebase files are local, Git-ignored inputs.
Validate their presence through repository tooling without printing values.
Release-candidate, Store, live-provider and production commands are separate
gated actions and are never implied by a normal build or regression task.
